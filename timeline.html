         <a id="e1954">Radar Guns - 1954</a>
           <div>Radar guns, instruments used to measure a vehicle's speed, are invented by Bryce K. Brown in March of 1954, and are used to issue a speeding ticket a month later.</div>

	 <a id="e1958">The Side-Handle Baton - 1958</a>
	  <div>A former marine invents the side-handle baton, which is more effective for many officers than the original baton, which was basically a glorified club. The new baton requires far more extensive training to be used effectively, however, the training is worth it.</div>
	 <a id="e1967">More Technology - 1967</a>
	  <div>The President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administrative Justice finds that while many police departments have made good use of their new-found technology, most of it could have been adopted about 30 years earlier.</div>

	  <div>The National Institute of Justice begins development of a lightweight body armor made from kevlar.</div>
	 <a id="e1974">TASERs - 1974</a>
	  <div>The TASER is developed in its first incarnation, but is classified as a firearm due to its use of gunpowder in 1976.</div>
	 <a id="e1982">Pepper Spray - 1982</a>
	  <div>Pepper spray, also known as OC spray, after the compound it is composed of, is developed. It is an very useful non-lethal weapon.</div>
	 <a id="e1985">TASERs in Common Use - 1985</a>
	  <div>Police in every state are using TASERs, a useful non-lethal weapon, if used correctly.</div>
	 <a id="e1986">DNA Forensics - 1986</a>
	  <div>DNA evidence used to prove that Richard Buckland didn’t commit two murders, and is later used to prove that the murders were committed by Colin Pitchfork. This was the first use of such evidence</div>
	 <a id="e1993">Mostly Computerized - 1993</a>
	  <div>About 90% of large police departments use computers.</div>
	 <a id="e2005">Loud LRADs - 2005</a>
	  <div>First use of the LRAD, a device used to disperse crowds and to provide a means to speak over several communicators is first used to foiled a pirate attack on a cruise ship off the Somali coast.</div>
	 <a id="e2006">Gunshot Location - 2006</a>
	  <div>The ShotSpotter, a gunshot locater is first  installed. It is installed in Oakland, and provided local police with ability to precisely locate gunshots, as well as the ability to get to start rushing to the scene the instant the shot is fired.</div>
