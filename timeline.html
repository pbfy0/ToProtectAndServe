         <a id="e1954">Radar Guns - 1954</a>
           <div>Radar guns are instruments used to measure a vehicle's speed. They were invented by Bryce K. Brown, in March of 1954, and were used to issue a speeding ticket the next month.</div>
         <a id="e1955">Primitive Computer - 1955</a>
          <div>The New Orleans Police Department used a vacuum-tube machine, an early computer, to process arrests and warrants.</div>
	 <a id="e1958">The Side-Handle Baton - 1958</a>
	  <div>A former marine invented the side-handle baton, which is more effective for many officers than the original baton, which was basically a glorified club. The new baton requires far more extensive training to be used effectively, however, the training is worth it.</div>
	 <a id="e1967">More Technology - 1967</a>
	  <div>The President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administrative Justice found that while many police departments have made good use of their new-found technology, most of it could have been adopted earlier.</div>
	 <a id="e1968"> Call 911! - 1968</a>
	  <div>911 emergency calls were invented. It was first used in only a select few cities, but became widespread soon after. It allows citizens to get emergency help more easily.</div>
	 <a id="e1972">Better Armor - 1972</a>
	  <div>The National Institute of Justice began the development of a lightweight body armor made from Kevlar. This protected officers from bullets and other hazards.</div>
	 <a id="e1974">TASERs - 1974</a>
	  <div>The TASER was developed by Jack Cover, and was classified as a firearm due to its use of gunpowder two years later.</div>
	 <a id="e1982">Pepper Spray - 1982</a>
	  <div>Pepper spray, also known as OC spray, after the compound Oleoresin Capsicum, of which it is composed, is developed. It is a very effective non-lethal weapon.</div>
	 <a id="e1985">TASERs Put into Common Use - 1985</a>
	  <div>Police in every state are using TASERs. They prove to be useful, when used correctly.</div>
	 <a id="e1986">DNA Forensics - 1986</a>
	  <div>DNA evidence is used to exonerate Richard Buckland of two murders he did not commit, and is later used to prove that the murders were committed by Colin Pitchfork. This was the first use of such evidence.</div>
	 <a id="e1993">Mostly Computerized - 1993</a>
	  <div>About 90% of police departments are now using computers.</div>
	 <a id="e2005">Loud LRADs - 2005</a>
	  <div>The LRAD, or Long Range Acoustic Device is first used in 2005 to combat pirates in Somalia.</div>
	 <a id="e2006">Gunshot Location - 2006</a>
	  <div>The ShotSpotter, a gunshot locator is first  installed in Oakland, California. It provides the local police with the ability to precisely locate gunshots, as well as the ability to rush to the scene the instant the shot is fired.</div>
