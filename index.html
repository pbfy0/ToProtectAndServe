  Since the most ancient of civilizations, there have been acts which are considered bad and immoral. Our sense of justice is part of this. To prevent these crimes, many communities have given people the job of preventing these crimes and bringing their perpetrators to justice. In modern times, people are governed by laws which dictate how they act. These laws are enforced by police, a form of law enforcement. Since 1950, many law enforcement agencies have figured out that using advanced technology is a way to make their job safer and easier. For example, their adoption of body armor helps police officers survive dangerous situations where criminals are shooting at them.

  This website is the result of innumerable hours of brainstorming, coding, researching, and writing, about law enforcement officers and their technology. We included an interview with a police officer, a  brief timeline of police technology, a list of the top ten technologies, and more.</p>
