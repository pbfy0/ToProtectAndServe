Since the most ancient of civilizations, there have been acts which are considered criminal or immoral. Our sense of justice and morality shapes what we consider crimes. To prevent these crimes, many communities have given people the job of preventing these crimes and bringing their perpetrators to justice. In modern times, people are governed by laws which dictate how they act. These laws are enforced by police, a form of law enforcement. Since 1950, many law enforcement agencies have figured out that using advanced technology is a way to make their job safer and easier. For example, their adoption of body armor helps police officers survive dangerous situations where criminals are shooting at them.

  <br />
Since the 1950's, a popular saying in the law enforcement community has been "To Protect and Serve." This saying essentially highlights the purpose of law enforcement, which is to keep the community safe within the structure of the laws governing it. Adopting better and more technologies is a great way for police departments to aid in this goal.

This website is the result of innumerable hours of brainstorming, coding, researching, and writing about law enforcement officers and their technology. We included an <a href="interview.html">interview</a> with a police officer, a  brief <a href="timeline.html">timeline</a> of police technology, a list of the <a href="technology.html">top ten developing technologies</a>, and more.</p>
