  <a href="#">Social Consequences of Police Technology</a>
  <div>
    <p>
      The public often wonders how police technology will impact their freedoms and privacy. When police get a new surveillance technology, many people fear the creation of a police state. In this age of texts and emails, our personal and private information is often transmitted in the form of electromagnetic waves, which allows for them to be intercepted. However, organizations that posses the capability to effectively do this are those more concerned with information gathering (spying).
<br />
<br />
      While reading our emails isn't often done by police, many law enforcement officers are concerned with what to do with our privacy when it can increasingly be violated. A common question is "public privacy or public safety?" The debate is effectively brought to light with the discussion of police using drones, or <strong>u</strong>nmanned <strong>a</strong>erial <strong>v</strong>ehicles (UAVs).
<br />
<br />
      Even before the use of UAVs by police, the possibility of their doing so has been under attack. Aviation law professor Joseph Vadek writes in his article "Big Brother Will Soon Be Watching--Or Will He?" "Once the bottleneck has passed and every police department does indeed have eyes everywhere, our notions of privacy under the Fourth Amendment and reasonable searches … will need to be reevaluated," and "It seems the state will have the power, both constitutionally and technologically, to continually monitor its citizens from above." 
<br />
<br />
      The perceived threat of police UAVs has almost made them extinct before they are even in widespread use. "To me, it’s Big Brother in the sky," said Dave Norris, a city councilman in Charlottesville, Va., referencing George Orwell's <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em> which posits an extremely totalitarian state ruled by "Big Brother." In February 2013 Charlottesville became the country's first city to restrict drone use. Nevertheless, the Charlottesville police department didn't posses a UAV or the intention of acquiring one.
<br />
<br />
      However, there are benefits of UAV use. For example, UAVs often cost less than the helicopters that they could replace, and since they are newer, often have cutting-edge technology built in. They have also had some success. In 2011, the Nelson County (VA) Police Department used a predator B drone to figure out that a suspect was in fact unarmed.
<br />
<br />
      As one can see, many aspects of enforcing the law are balancing the rights and freedoms of those being policed and being able to police them well. As of yet, both parties haven't reached a compromise they can not grumble about.

  <a href="#">Economic Consequences of Police Technology</a>
  <div>
    <p>
Economically, these technologies have done a great deal for society. Since the economic recession in 2008, police departments have had their budgets slashed. Thus, they have had to make do with less. Though many of the technologies are very expensive, they allow police officers to be far more effective, and in some cases, do so and save money, as is the case with the <a href="technology.html">Recon Scout</a>, a $9,000 robotic throwable camera that replaced a $20,000 dog in several police departments.
<br />
<br />
America’s police departments are in a state of testing many new <a href="technology.html">technologies</a>, some of which show promise. These technologies cost a lot of money, and this eats a large chunk from the department’s budget, which often comes from taxes. However, the recent changes in police technology may not have had enough time to truly affect the economy.
<br />
<br />
Another aspect of police acquiring new, advanced technology is the effect that it will have on the companies that manufacture it. For many recently started companies doing businessin the technology industry, law enforcement agencies are a primary buyer. For instance, the LRAD Corporation, which makes and sells <a href="technology.html">LRADs,</a> sells many to police departments. As long as police departments look for new technologies to aid them, the market for them will continue.

  <a href="#">Political Impacts of Police Technology</a>
  <div>
    <p>
      Politically, the technology of law enforcement has created much debate about the freedoms of citizens. However, as law enforcement agencies try to balance the policing well and the privacy of those being policed, politicians get dragged in. There have been many instances of police searching without a search warrant, often provoking a court case, such as in United States vs. Jones.
