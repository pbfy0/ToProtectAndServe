    Non-Lethal Weapons
  </h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      Non-lethal weapons are one of the many types of emerging technologies in the field of law enforcement. As their name implies, non-lethal weapons are devices used to incapacitate their targets rather than kill them.

        The T.A.S.E.R, or <strong>T</strong>homas <strong>A. S</strong>wift <strong>E</strong>lectric <strong>R</strong>ifle, is  the best known non-lethal weapon. Invented in 1974 by Jack Cover, it was actually named after his hero Thomas A. Swift. Similar to the stun gun, the T.A.S.E.R. uses a powerful electric shock to incapacitate the target. However, unlike the stun gun, which requires direct contact, the T.A.S.E.R.  can be used from a distance, of up to 35 feet. It works by firing two metal prongs into the target which then generate an electric current with 0.02-0.04 amps, incapacitating him/her. However, the affects are not as strong if the target is under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because it is non-lethal if used correctly, the TASER gives police an alternative to shooting at criminals with guns to incapacitate them, which often ends up resulting in someone’s death. However, TASERs aren’t often as effective as guns, because of their limited range and the small number of shots they can hold. Because there have been several incidents of death after people have been tased far too many times, TASERs have won much scrutiny, and are considered an instrument of torture by several organizations due to the pain they cause on their targets. There have also been many incidents involving TASERs that were “an excessive use of force” by the police involved. Although there is much controversy surrounding the TASER, it has still saved in excess of 105,293 lives due to its ability to not kill its targets (though this may be a biased statistic; it came from taser.com). As a result of their general non-lethality, TASERs are a common sight on the belts of many police officers.

        <p>
          The Long Range Acoustic Device, or LRAD, is a non-lethal weapon and mass-communication device. It uses sound to create pain by making a loud high frequency noises, or can simply be used as a very loud and long ranged speaker system. These sounds can cause people to stop what they are doing (say, attacking a ship) and cover their ears to block the sound. It can also be used for communication. Its clear, long range sounds can be understood from almost a kilometer away. It has been used to warn boats to move out of the way for military ships, and is also an effective crowd control tool.
        </p>
        <p>
          The LRAD works by creating sound with piezoelectric transducers. Piezoelectric transducer changes electricity into sound by having positive and negative elements that align when in the presence of an electrical field. By alternating electrical fields one can cause the material to flip back and forth very quickly. Instead of having one big diaphragm, like a stereo, the LRAD has many small piezoelectric transducers in a staggered pattern. This can create a very loud high frequency noise.
        </p>
        <p>
          The LRAD can be used as a non-lethal weapon by creating such a loud high frequency noise it causes pain. At about 130 dB (depending on the person’s pain tolerance) a sound is loud enough to cause pain in the ears. Even though it is a non-lethal weapon there are side effects of being subject to an LRAD such as hearing loss, tinnitus, insomnia, high blood pressure and abnormal heart rate. There is some controversy about the use of the LRAD because even though it is non-lethal it can cause permanent ear damage. Even short exposures to such loud sounds can be very bad for ones hearing and it won’t come back. Also, the LRAD’s effects can be easily be neutralized wearing earbuds or earmuffs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though it has flaws and it’s effect can easily be nullified the LRAD is a good crowd controller and is good for sending messages. It has been used to defend ships. In 2005, a ship named the Seabourn Spirit was attacked by pirates. The pirates were equipped with machine guns and rocket propelled grenades. The Seabourn Spirit had an LRAD. The LRAD allowed the ship to repulse the pirates with no conflict. The LRAD is a fairly new technology that can be used in many situations, preventing violence and dangerous rioting.

      Detecting Crime and Catching Criminals
    </h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Technologies that help with this are used to detect a crime or potentially dangerous situation, the advantage of this being that police officers are able to respond better.
      </p>
      <div class="pop boxes">
        <a href="#">ShotSpotter</a>
        <div>
          <p>
            The ShotSpotter is a new technology used in large cities to precisely locate a gunshot; they are usually installed in the more dangerous parts of the city. It is very precise in locating the gunshot, but it has several drawbacks. First, the ShotSpotter will sometimes pick up sounds similar to a gunshot, such as firecrackers and construction work. The ShotSpotter is also expensive. In Boston, the local police department paid $1.5 million to install the system and maintenance costs from $150,000 to $175,000 per year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like most new technologies, there is some controversy about privacy, with people saying that the ShotSpotter is almost like wiretapping; it can listen in on what people are saying. The general argument against this is that the sensors are in public areas—mounted on utility poles and on top of buildings—and if people didn’t want anything to be overheard they shouldn’t have been speaking in public anyways. Also, ShotSpotters aren’t activated until they hear a gunshot, in which case they start to record. A ShotSpotter can locate a gunshot within 25 meters. Each ShotSpotter detector is about the size of a thick piece of gum, and is enclosed in a protective case that’s about the size of a loaf of bread. To locate a gunshot one needs several sensors; each sensor will detect how far away the gun was shot.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the ShotSpotter, police have found that many gunshots are not reported. There may be a reason for this. According to Winston Robinson, the assistant police chief in Washington DC "A lot of these folks who have pistols and guns routinely fire them for no reason at all." Still, there are some instances where there are hurt victims. The ShotSpotter also gets officers to the crime scene as quickly as possible, as they are notified almost immediately. All in all, the ShotSpotter seems to be a very helpful technology, allowing policemen to more effectively catch criminals and potentially help victims.

        <a href="#">GPS Darts</a>
        <div>
          GPS Darts are small GPS devices that can be shot out of a gun-like machine mounted to the front of a police car. They attach to the back of a fleeing criminal’s car and track the car. Every three to five seconds the police will get an update on where the car is. These devices are far more exact than traditional GPS devices. The GPS darts allow police officers to track a vehicle without actively pursuing it, thus avoiding a car chase that can be dangerous to not only the people partaking in it (the police and whoever is being chased), but bystanders as well. The criminal will often slow down because they are not being chased by a police officer following them, and can also be ambushed. The GPS dart was put into effect for the first time this year in Austin, Texas. The system costs $4,900 per car, and each dart costs $250. The National Institute of Justice helped pay for these costs. The Austin Police Department hopes this new technology will enhance the safety of their officers and citizens.

        <a href="#">LIDAR</a>
        <div>
          <p>
            A police department’s job is to keep people safe; including making sure people aren’t driving too fast. To make sure people aren’t speeding, the police have a variety of devices to track speeders and record their license plate numbers. Because people tend to dislike getting speeding tickets, websites have been created such as Trapster.com, where people share where speed traps are. This is very useful to the police and citizens alike; the police don’t need to chase people down to ticket them, and the citizens are benefitted by not being ticketed. In the words of Gabriel Medrano, of the Texas Dept. of Public Safety “It’s not hurting our job for public safety. When they put that stuff out there, they slow down at that spot we are at. It is actually helping with public safety.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Technologies such as LIDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) allow the police to figure out how fast drivers are moving quickly and accurately, and this technology is replacing radar as a means to do this. Drivers also have new technologies to foil LIDAR. A Laser Jammer essentially blocks the LIDAR from giving a speed reading by sending waves back at the LIDAR machine at the same wavelength with a higher intensity. These are not to be confused with radar jammers, and are legal in most states. You can buy laser detectors too. There are a few problems with these though; they are a slightly expensive, at around $399. Also, they don’t warn one of the laser beforehand; it beeps after the laser has been detected, which is too late.

        <a href="#">Recon Scouts</a>
        <div>
          <p>
            In several police departments, police departments have started using a throwable robot, the Recon Scout, as an extra pair of eyes. The robot can move on its own as well, if told to do so via a wireless controller. Many police departments use a dog to scope out dangers, but this can present as risk to the animal, an emotional and $20,000 asset. So instead, several police departments have started using a Recon Scout, which costs a comparatively less $9,000, and if it is destroyed, then at least police officers know where a bad guy is. However, the device requires at least two police officers to operate because though it can be effectively operated by one person, another officer is needed to cover the person operating the device. Overall, the device is a technological step up from the specially trained dogs that it replaces. It is used for several things. The Minneapolis Police Department sends them under vehicles to look for suspicious looking packages or bombs. According to Sgt. Carter Staaf "You can dream up the scenarios that you want to use them for.

        <div>
          <p>
            Officers do need to do paperwork; it’s part of their job, but it would be more useful to have them on patrol where they can arrest criminals and maintain order. The Clearwater Police Department in Florida completely got rid of their need for officers taking time to type things. They did this by installing voice commanded computers in their cars. Dragon Dictation is an application that changes speech to text on a computer or smartphone. It allows officers to spend a lot less time writing reports. Departments found that it sped up writing reports by 68% on average. It has a 99% accuracy rate. Officers have found their write ups becoming more precise and detailed perhaps because the scene was more fresh on their mind and they could speak more like telling a story without worrying about typing it. This has the added benefit of having officers spending less time writing reports and more time on the beat.

          <p>
            Tablets are very useful for police officers. They can be used to record witness reports or have a lineup on the spot. Once, police officers caught a suspect in 15 minutes. A photo lineup was taken and emailed to an officer on the crime scene. An iPad can track where and when crimes were committed. Tablet technology is getting more and more advanced, and officers love them. "Hopefully this will become such an integral part of modern law enforcement that when you hire an officer, you issue a gun, a badge, a baton, a smartphone, and a tablet," says Lt. Chris Catren, who spearheaded the Redlands (Calif.) Police Department's adoption of iPads. "It's just another item of police equipment that we need to provide to our officers." Unfortunately, tablets are still a luxuries for most police officers running on tight budgets.

        <div>
          <p>
            Statistics have found more and more officers are getting shot at for two consecutive years. 92% of police officers now say they are required to wear body armor. Some people target officers because they are officers. Body armor protects from knife attacks, car accidents and most bullets. It protects police officers by essentially trapping a bullet in layers of ballistic fibers. The fibers disperse the energy, spreading it over a larger area. Generally, the armor is made with different ballistic panels. The ballistic panels can be inserted into a “carrier” which is made of a normal clothing material, such as cotton. These carriers may be removable or sewn in. The ballistic panels are layers of ballistic material, such as kevlar, stitched together, either at the edges or tack stitched together. These ballistic panels can be made of different materials, that serve different purposes; a manufacturer can add a layer in a panel just to reduce blunt trauma. Body armor has saved many lives. Also, wearing body armor can increase confidence, which is very important, especially in high stress situations. It can be a powerful contributor to the success of a police officer.

        <div>
          <p>
            The FBI is using grid computing to save time and computer power. Before the FBI implemented grid computing, each computer was being used for about eight hours a day. That means for 16 hours every day, the computer was not being used. “There’s so much processing power, it would be a waste for us not to use it, especially when it can help protect the American people,” said Special Agent Jason Jarnagin, a unit chief in the Digital Evidence Section of the FBI’s Operational Technology Division (OTD). With grid computing, a program is installed that allows the computers to process data while not being used. Every resting computer can run calculations tied to terrorist and criminal investigations. This is very useful, as they sort through data that could have taken years to sift through otherwise. OTD Assistant Director Marcus Thomas calls the FBI’s effort, which is not open to the public, “the largest supercomputer dedicated solely to law enforcement.” This system is very powerful, efficient, and useful, and it helps the FBI fight crime and solve mysteries.
