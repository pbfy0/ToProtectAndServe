   <h2>Non-Lethal Weapons</h2>
   <div>
    <p>These weapons are designed to have a low chance of killing their target. Because bringing someone to justice rarely involves killing them, these weapons have become fairly popular.</p>
    <div class="pop boxes"><a href="#">TASERs</a><div>Although TASERs were invented some years ago in 1974, they are still being developed today, and it was in the 1980s when they came into common use. TASERs (Tom A. Swift’s Electric Rifle) are essentially primitive stun guns that work by transmitting an electric charge down a cables connected to darts that are shot into the target’s body. The electric charge shocks the target’s body and can immobilize it, although the effect is somewhat less pronounced on people who are under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Because it is non-lethal if used correctly, the TASER gives police an alternative to shooting at criminals with guns to incapacitate them, which often ends up resulting in someone’s death. However, TASERs aren’t often as effective as guns, because of their limited range and the small number of shots they can hold. Because there have been several incidents of death after people have been tased far too many times, TASERs have won much scrutiny, and are considered an instrument of torture by several organizations due to the pain they cause on their targets. There have also been many incidents involving TASERs that were “an excessive use of force” by the police involved. Although there is much controversy surrounding the TASER, it has still saved in excess of 105,293 lives due to its ability to not kill its targets (though this may be a biased statistic; it came from taser.com). As a result of their general non-lethality, TASERs are a common sight on the belts of many police officers.

    <p>Technologies that help with this are used to detect a crime or potentially dangerous situation, the advantage of this being that police officers are able to respond better.</p>
