    Non-Lethal Weapons
  </h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      Non-lethal weapons are one of the many types of emerging technologies in the field of law enforcement. As their name implies, non-lethal weapons are devices used to incapacitate their targets rather than kill them.
    </p>
    <div class="item">
      <a href="#">TASERs</a>
      <div>
        <div class="img">

        </div>
        <p>
          The TASER, or <strong>T</strong>homas <strong>A. S</strong>wift <strong>E</strong>lectric <strong>R</strong>ifle, is the best known non-lethal weapon. Invented in 1974 by Jack Cover, it was actually named after his hero Thomas A. Swift. Similar to the stun gun, the TASER uses a powerful electric shock to incapacitate the target. However, unlike the stun gun, which requires direct contact, the TASER can be used from a distance of up to 35 feet. It works by firing two metal prongs into the target, which then generate an electric current with 0.02-0.04 amps, and the equivalence of 50,000 volts. TASERs have been reported to have saved 90,000 lives, however, there are still many controversies regarding their use.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, there are the physical limitations. They are less effective than a gun by the nature of their more limited range, and the smaller number of shots that they can hold. The metal prongs can only penetrate 1 to 2 inches, making this a less effective choice in cold climates where the target might be wearing a heavy sweater and a coat. They are bulkier, awkward to holster and considerably more difficult to carry around than the average hand gun. These limitations could put an officer at risk if he/she is less able to gain control of a dangerous situation. Second, and by far the bigger controversy associated with TASERs, is with respect to their overall safety. Though designed to be nonlethal, they have caused hundreds of deaths. The safety data was generated through testing healthy individuals in neutral situations. However, TASERs are often used on people in high adrenaline states with disproportionate history of mental illness, as well as drug and alcohol addictions putting this population at higher risk for occult heart disease. Between 2001 and 2007 there were 277 TASER related deaths reported, presumably from sudden cardiac death. If the use of the TASER was a simple one to one replacement for the use of a standard firearm, than these would be acceptable figures. Presumably, the standard firearm would create greater morbidity and mortality. However, one wonders if the false sense of absolute safety, would result in more readily use of this type of force, increasing the number of casualties.

        <p>
          Another nonlethal weapon is the <strong>L</strong>ong <strong>R</strong>ange <strong>A</strong>coustic <strong>D</strong>evice, or "LRAD" for short. Capable of sending a sound over a distance one kilometer, the LRAD has been used as a communications tool, as well as to stop riots, and even pirates.
        </p>
        <p>
          The LRAD works by using piezoelectric transducers to produce sound. Piezoelectric transducer changes electricity into sound by having positive and negative elements that align when in the presence of an electrical field. By alternating electrical fields one can cause the material to flip back and forth very quickly. Instead of having one big diaphragm, like a stereo, the LRAD has many small piezoelectric transducers in a staggered pattern. This can create a very loud high frequency noise.
        </p>
        <p>
          The LRAD can be used as a non-lethal weapon by creating such a loud high frequency noise it causes pain. At about 130 dB (depending on the person’s pain tolerance) a sound is loud enough to cause pain in the ears. Even though it is a non-lethal weapon there are side effects of being subject to an LRAD such as hearing loss, tinnitus, insomnia, high blood pressure and abnormal heart rate. There is some controversy about the use of the LRAD because even though it is non-lethal it can cause permanent ear damage. Even short exposures to such loud sounds can be very bad for ones hearing and it won’t come back. Also, the LRAD’s effects can be easily be neutralized wearing earplugs or earmuffs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though it has flaws and it’s effect can easily be nullified the LRAD is a good crowd controller and is good for sending messages. It has been used to defend ships. In 2005, a ship named the Seabourn Spirit was attacked by pirates. The pirates were equipped with machine guns and rocket propelled grenades. The Seabourn Spirit had an LRAD. The LRAD allowed the ship to repulse the pirates with no conflict. The LRAD is a fairly new technology that can be used in many situations, preventing violence and dangerous rioting.

      Detecting Crime and Catching Criminals
    </h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Here you will find technologies that help law enforcement officers detect crimes and find those who commit them. They allow police to stop crimes-in-progress, and gain an advantage over criminals and evil-doers.

        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            With gun violence becoming a larger problem, a solution is becoming more and more necessarily. The ShotSpotter can help combat that problem. The ShotSpotter is a new technology used in large cities to precisely locate gunshots. It is usually installed in the more dangerous parts of the city, where gun violence is more common. When a gun is fired, the ShotSpotter accurately locates the shot and notifies the police. A ShotSpotter can locate a gunshot to within 25 meters of its actual location. Each ShotSpotter detector is about the size of a thick piece of gum, and is enclosed in a protective case that’s about the size of a loaf of bread. To locate a gunshot, several sensors are needed; each sensor will detect how far away the gun was shot.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ShotSpotter has been proven to be very useful. Police have found that many gunshots that the ShotSpotter has found have not been reported by civilians. There may be a reason for this. According to Winston Robinson, the assistant police chief in Washington DC, "A lot of these folks who have pistols and guns routinely fire them for no reason at all." Still, there are some instances where there are hurt victims. The ShotSpotter also gets officers to the crime scene as quickly as possible, as they are notified almost immediately. All in all, the ShotSpotter seems to be a very helpful technology, allowing policemen to more effectively catch criminals and potentially help victims. However, the ShotSpotter is not without its drawbacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Firstly, the ShotSpotter will sometimes pick up sounds similar to a gunshot, such as firecrackers and construction work. This creates many problems, with police rushing to the scene, only to find a group of construction workers digging up a road.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, the ShotSpotter is expensive. In Boston, the local police department paid $1.5 million to install the system, not to mention the maintenance costs of $150,000 to $175,000 per year.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, like many new law enforcement technologies, there is some controversy about the privacy of the ShotSpotter. Many people believe that the ShotSpotter is extremely invasive, like bugs, or wiretaps: it can listen in on what people are saying. The general counter-argument is that the ShotSpotter sensors are in public areas—mounted on utility poles and on top of buildings—and that if people don't want anything to be overheard, then they shouldn't be speaking in public. Also, ShotSpotters aren't even activated until they hear a gunshot, at which point they start to record.

        </div>
        <div>
          One of the many problems police officers face is when a suspect flees the scene in a car. GPS, or <strong>G</strong>lobal <strong>P</strong>ositioning <strong>S</strong>ystem darts can solve that problem. GPS darts are small GPS devices that can be shot out of a gun-like machine, which is mounted to t
he front of a police car. They can attach to the back of a fleeing criminal’s car and use the GPS to track the car. Every three to five seconds the police will get an update on where the car is. The GPS darts allow police officers to track a vehicle without actively pursuing it, thus avoiding a car chase that can be dangerous to not only the people partaking in it (the police and whoever is being chased), but bystanders as well. The criminal will often slow down because they are not being chased by a police officer following them, and can also be ambushed. The GPS dart was put into effect for the first time this year in Austin, Texas. The system costs $4,900 per police car, and each dart costs $250. The National Institute of Justice does help pay for these costs. The Austin Police Department hopes that this new technology will enhance the safety of their officers and citizens.

        <a href="#">LIDAR</a>
        <div>
          <p>
            A police department's job is to keep people safe. This includes making sure people aren't driving too fast. To make sure people aren't speeding, the police have a variety of devices to track speeding drivers and record their license plate numbers. Because people dislike getting speeding tickets, websites have been created such as Trapster.com, where people share where speed traps are. This is very useful to the police and citizens alike; the police don’t need to chase people down to ticket them, and the citizens are benefited by not being ticketed. In the words of Gabriel Medrano, of the Texas Dept. of Public Safety “It’s not hurting our job for public safety. When they put that stuff out there, they slow down at that spot we are at. It is actually helping with public safety.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Technologies such as LIDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) allow the police to figure out how fast drivers are moving quickly and accurately, and this technology is replacing radar as a means to do this. Drivers also have new technologies to foil LIDAR. A Laser Jammer essentially blocks the LIDAR from giving a speed reading by sending waves back at the LIDAR machine at the same wavelength with a higher intensity. These are not to be confused with radar jammers, and are legal in most states. You can buy laser detectors too. There are a few problems with these though; they are a slightly expensive, at around $399. Also, they don’t warn one of the laser beforehand; it beeps after the laser has been detected, which is too late.

        <a href="#">Recon Scouts</a>
        <div>
          <p>
            In several police departments, police departments have started using a throw-able robot, the Recon Scout, as an extra pair of eyes in potentially dangerous situations. They used for several things. The Minneapolis Police Department sends them under vehicles to look for suspicious looking packages or bombs. According to Sgt. Carter Staaf "You can dream up the scenarios that you want to use them for. The robot can move on it's own, if told to do so via a wireless controller. Many police departments use a dog to scope out dangers, but this can present a risk to the animal, an emotional and $20,000 asset. To avoid this loss, several police departments have started using Recon Scouts, which costs a considerably less $9,000 each. And if they are destroyed, police officers still will know where the bad guy is. However, the device requires at least two police officers in order to function, because though it can be effectively operated by one person, another officer is needed to cover the person operating the device. Overall, the devices are a technological step up from the specially trained dogs that they replaces.

        <div>
          <p>
            A large portion of a law enforcement officers job is filling out paperwork. However, it would be more useful to have them on patrol where they can arrest criminals and maintain order. Thankfully, there is a solution: Dragon Dictation. Dragon Dictation is an application that changes speech to text on a computer or smartphone. It allows officers to spend a lot less time writing reports. In fact, the Clearwater Police Department in Florida completely got rid of their need for officers taking time to type things, by installing this voice-command technology into their cars. Departments found that it sped up writing reports by 68% on average, and has a 99% accuracy rate. Officers have found their write ups becoming more precise and detailed. This is perhaps because the scene was more fresh on their mind and they could speak more like telling a story without worrying about typing it. This has the added benefit of having officers spending less time writing reports and more time on the beat.

          <p>
            Tablets are very useful for police officers. They can be used to record witness reports or have a lineup on the spot. Once, police officers caught a suspect in 15 minutes. A photo lineup was taken and emailed to an officer on the crime scene. An iPad can track where and when crimes were committed. Tablet technology is getting more and more advanced, and officers love them. "Hopefully this will become such an integral part of modern law enforcement that when you hire an officer, you issue a gun, a badge, a baton, a smartphone, and a tablet," says Lt. Chris Catren, who spearheaded the Redlands (Calif.) Police Department's adoption of iPads. "It's just another item of police equipment that we need to provide to our officers." Unfortunately, tablets are still a luxuries for most police officers running on tight budgets.

          <p>
            Statistics have found that more and more officers are getting shot at during the past two years. To prevent deaths from shootings, many law enforcement officers turn to new innovations in body armor. In fact, 92% of police officers now say they are required to wear body armor. Body armor protects from knife attacks, many types of blunt force, and most bullets. 
          </p>
          <p>
             Body armor protects law enforcement officers by essentially trapping the bullet in layers of ballistic fibers. These fibers disperse the energy, by spreading it over a larger area. Most body armor is made with many different ballistic panels. The ballistic panels can be inserted into a “carrier” which is made of a normal clothing material, such as cotton. These carriers may be removable or sewn in. The ballistic panels are layers of ballistic material, such as Kevlar, stitched together, either at the edges or tack-stitched together. These ballistic panels can be made of different materials, that each serve different purposes: a manufacturer can add a layer in a panel just to reduce blunt trauma, and another to prevent bullets from penetrating. Body armor has saved many lives. Also, wearing body armor can increase confidence, which is very important, especially in high stress situations. It can be a powerful contributor to the success, and safety of a police officer.

            Law enforcement officers also use new computer technology, to save time and energy. An example of this is the FBI. They are now using grid computing to save time and computer power. Before the FBI implemented grid computing, each computer was being used for about eight hours a day. That means for 16 hours of every day, the computers were not being used. “There’s so much processing power, it would be a waste for us not to use it, especially when it can help protect the American people,” said Special Agent Jason Jarnagin, a unit chief in the Digital Evidence Section of the FBI’s <strong>O</strong>perational <strong>T</strong>echnology <strong>D</strong>ivision (OTD). With grid computing, a program is installed that allows the computers to process data when they are not being used. Every resting computer can run calculations tied to terrorist and criminal investigations. This is very useful, as they sort through data that could have taken years to sift through otherwise. OTD Assistant Director Marcus Thomas calls the FBI’s effort, which is not open to the public, “the largest supercomputer dedicated solely to law enforcement.” This system is very powerful, efficient, and useful. It helps the FBI fight crime and solve mysteries.
